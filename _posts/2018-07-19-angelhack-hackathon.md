I recently attended a hackathon organized by AngelHack in Washington DC. It was my first hackathon ever and it was unforgettable! For that, I have to thank my friend and colleague Mheni Merzouki, to whom I said "no" many times before, but who insisted that I tag along. The experience was memorable, challenging, and I learned a great deal from it. Read on for more details.

## What is a hackathon?

Let's start by breaking down the word "hackathon." The first part is "hack" which is a common verb, and it's funny how whenever people hear it, they start picturing a guy wearing a black hat or a hoodie, sitting in a dark room surrounded by computers that display green or red lines on black screens whenever he rapidly types on one of his many keyboards. Well, that's normal I guess, since that's how movies portray hackers. No, "hack" in this context simply means "to write code." The second part is the suffix "athon," which is extracted from the word marathon, and it's a suffix that usually occurs at the end of words that have a general sense of lengthy events.

So for those who don't know what a hackathon is: it's an event where computer programmers, software developers, product managers, graphic designers and others gather to collaborate and engage in computer programming or "hacking." Usually hackathons last from 24 up to 48 hours, and sometimes more. Wow, 48 hours of nonstop hacking! It sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? Well, believe it or not, people can do it.

At the end of the hacking session, a pitching session starts and that's when the contestants present their ideas to a jury and the other competitors. Prizes and awards are granted to the winners.

Other than improving coding skills, hackathons are a good chance for meeting new people, networking, and getting involved in the world of entrepreneurship and business.

## Who organized this hackathon?

As I mentioned above, the organizers of this event were [AngelHack](https://angelhack.com/). They are a global hackathon organization that was founded in 2011. As one of their representatives, [Madison Andermahr](https://angelhack.com/team/madison-andermahr/), explained to me, every year they tour the world for a yearly Global Hackathon Series where contestants compete to create and test solutions for the given challenges, and every year these challenges fall under a specific theme. This year's theme is Seamless Technology, and the idea of this theme is that:

> Hackathons are built for rapid innovation, and rapid isn't always pretty. But no matter the roadblock, broken code or bumps, we continue on and push forward, together. There's no boundary or limit to what we can create.
>
> AngelHack.

Other than the different hackathons organized across the globe, they run a program called HACKcelerator. If hacking were a sport, the Global Hackathon Series would be the different divisions and the HACKcelerator would be the playoffs. The reason behind the creation of such program is that over a weekend each team puts a lot of effort to cook a solution that is respectable, however that is not yet at the level of a startup. So, the idea was to have a program that provides mentorship to entrepreneurs and promotes their not yet fully fledged solutions to investors. You can read more about the program on its [official webpage](https://angelhack.com/hackcelerator/).

## Where do I fit in all this?

My colleague and I arrived at the event around 9AM, at a place called the Fridge in Capitol Hill, DC. We were greeted by the representatives, Madison and her 10 years long friend. We were offered the hackathon t-shirts, a couple of stickers each, and were invited to take whatever we wanted from the kitchenette. We were then shown a couple of available seats. Although we were on time, it was a full house, and it looked like the event was already underway, but it was not.

    - 1:00 PM : Lunch
    - 2:00 PM : Sponsor Breakout Sessions
    - 7:00 PM : Dinner
    - 10:00 PM : Pitch Workshop

    - 1:30 PM : A/V Check
    - 2:00 PM : Demos
    - 4:00 PM : Winners are Announced / Prizes!

Some contestants formed their teams beforehand, others, my colleague and I included, were waiting to join or form a team. We decided to form our own. We pitched our idea and were able to convince a couple of entrants to join us. We decided to take on the Fitbit challenge that says: "_...inspire users to live a healthier, more active life_". So we decided to make **an app that would allow users to track allergies (tree pollen, mold, dander, etc.) in their area, and notify them to take precautions in case of extreme conditions**.

Saturday, 11:00 AM. Let the hacking begin! The energy in the room was palpable. The loud sound of chatter and keystrokes washed over me after a while and turned into white noise.

Since none of us played with a Fitbit before (I personally never had one, let alone develop an app on it), we invested a couple of hours in figuring out the Fitbit APIs and the development environment. Once that was done, we split the tasks up into independent, loosely coupled pieces. My task was to interact with the [AccuWeather public APIs](https://developer.accuweather.com/), retrieve the allergy related data, and process them before sending them to the view logic. The 3 grande cups of coffee that I had kicked in on time and did their job keeping me awake for 24 hours nonstop. I spent the whole night coding in JavaScript, which is not my forte, but I am proud of what I achieved.

Sunday, 2:00 PM. It's demo time! Presentation order was decided in a first in, first out manner, i.e. first to submit, first to present. Contestants lined up accordingly and pitched their projects to the panel of judges. Some ideas were innovative, others were realistic, and others (with all due respect) were just crazy. For example, a contestant wanted to raise funds to build a chapel on the moon.

## What I learned from this experience?

This was my first hackathon ever. I undoubtedly learned a lot of things from this event, and on many levels.

**Technical**: I discovered the Fitbit development environment and APIs. I learned how to develop a fully fledged app on Fitbit and actually developed one that connects to the outside world, and was able to deploy it on the Fitbit Ionic that was provided by AngelHack. I learned about AccuWeather and their API. I brushed up my JavaScript knowledge. I now know how to deal with a couple of Github related issues that kept coming up repeatedly.

**Entrepreneurial**: social entrepreneurship is not something that I was envisioning a lot before this hackathon. Now I am more excited about it than ever, after watching the competing teams pitch and present their ideas. And as I mentioned before, hackathons are a great chance to meet entrepreneurs and investors, pitch and sell your ideas, and enlarge your circle of contacts.

**Team work**: it's really challenging and interesting to figure out how 4 strangers work and bond together, and how to split up tasks on team members fairly and based on their skillset.

**Project Management**: managing a whole project over 24 hours sounds very difficult, if not unfeasible. Overall, I could say that we were able to manage our resources and time effectively, since we met our deadlines and milestones, and our app was up and running by the end of the hacking session.


## What are my impressions?

Although we didn't win the challenge, we sure did very good, since the judges, other contestants, and attendants congratulated us and appreciated our idea. And unlike other teams, we had an app that was running live and getting real time data. And what matters most is that we had an enriching experience and a great time competing with the other teams.

It is amazing what could come out of a $10 a ticket event. $10 doesn't even cover the amount of food per person that was offered to us (coffee, breakfast, sandwiches, snacks, pizza, energy drinks, etc.).

Altogether it was a great experience. My team members were fun to work with and we bonded really well. The venue was clean, safe and comfortable, and the representatives were knowledgeable, nice and caring. For that, I would recommend anyone with an opportunity to go through such experience at least once. Now, I am looking forward to other hackathons.
