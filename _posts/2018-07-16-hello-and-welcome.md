Hello there and welcome to my blog.

I am so excited to finally have my own website and blog up and running. I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long.

I created this blog for two main reasons. The first, to be able to share my knowledge and the main events in my life with my family, my friends and the world -- and eventually my usual readers – and get their feedback. The second, I am very passionate about my work and what I do, and I want a way to document and archive it.

I am a network engineer and a wannabe software engineer. After graduating from Morocco in 2015, with a Networking and Telecommunications Engineering degree, I got an offer to join the National Institute of Standards and Technology for a research position in the field of Computer Networks. I accepted of course, as it is a great chance for me to widen my knowledge, improve my skills, and discover a new world and country. And...what a country!

I love technology, not just because I am a techie, but because technology is fascinating, isn’t it? Technology can’t stop amazing us day by day. Today, we are surrounded by a humongous amount of technological evolutions that encompass every aspect of our lives. You want to talk to someone who’s thousands of miles away? Easy, get your smartphone and get on one of the wide range of applications that allow that. You want to go somewhere and don’t have a car? Easy, get an Uber. You want to…"But Omar, for 2018, these are not as fascinating as you think they are". Hmm...Ok, what about virtual assistants, like Google assistant? You can order stuff online without touching your phone. Now, it can even [make a reservation or schedule an appointment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXUQ-DdSDoE) for you. What about self-driving cars? What about 3D printing? Do you know that today they use [3D printing to print organs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ6GQfXEmyM). Maybe soon we’ll hear about a successful surgery that involved a 3D-printed heart! And what about robots? Like [NASA’s Curiosity Rover who took a selfie in Mars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tqLk-Wl0Fo). What about drones? Recently, I heard that [Amazon has been using drones to deliver packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5hQHBNpd7s) to customers in 30 minutes or less. Well, the list is long and I think you got the point.

In this blog, I am going to be writing mainly about technology, and more specifically about computer networks and information technology. As I mentioned, I want to become a software engineer, and currently I am teaching myself how to become one, by reading books, watching videos, going through tutorials and writing code at and outisde of work. So this blog will be also a chance for me to share my progress, what I learned and what I discovered, and ask for advice too (why not?). For more details about my education or experience, please check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/elmimouni).

I hope you’d enjoy your ride through my blog, and you’d become a usual reader.

Yum yum, next post is cooking...come back soon.

Cheers!
