Welcome to my blog.

I started this blog in 2018 as a place to document what I learn and share it with others. Back then, I was a network engineer at NIST, teaching myself software development on the side.

A lot has changed since. I transitioned fully into software engineering and have spent the past several years building distributed systems, microservices, and backend APIs. The problems I work on now are different, but the curiosity that drove me to start this blog remains the same.

I write here occasionally about distributed systems, backend development, and lessons learned from building software at scale. If you find something useful, that is great. If not, at least I have a record of what I was thinking at the time.

Thanks for stopping by.
