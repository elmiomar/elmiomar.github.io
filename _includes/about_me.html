<h4>Who Am I?</h4>
<p>My name is Omar Ilias EL MIMOUNI. No, Ilias is not my middle name—I have two first names. My father wanted Omar, my mother preferred Ilias, and they couldn't agree. You can imagine the fun when paying online and guessing whether my bank used "Ilias" as a middle name.</p>
<p>I'm a software engineer based in the US. I graduated from Mohammedia School of Engineering in Morocco in 2015 with a Master's in Computer Networks and Telecommunications.</p>

<h4>What Do I Do?</h4>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer at Prometheus Computing, where I build software for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). My recent work includes architecting microservices with Spring Cloud, building REST APIs, developing Angular web applications, and containerizing services with Docker.</p>
<p>Before focusing on software, I spent two years as a Network Engineer at NIST, working on high-performance networking, SDN, and protocol development.</p>
<br>

<h4>Technologies I Work With</h4>
<p>My primary languages are Java (Spring Boot) and Python. I also work with TypeScript/Angular for frontend, PostgreSQL for databases, and Docker for containerization.</p>
<br>

<h4>Outside of Work</h4>
<p>I'm a huge soccer fan. Hala Madrid!
